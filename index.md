# About Me
Hello, my name is Glen Stevens and I am a Engineering, MS student at ASU's polytechnic campus in Mesa, AZ. I did my undergraduate degree in Robotics Engineering, focusing on mechanical design and embedded systems. My interests are directed towards mechanical design and robotics integration.

I have participated in multiple projects during my undergraduate degree, such as the development of a device to detect conditions to mold growth and a wearable health monitor to detect heart rate, blood oxygen levels, temperature and skin resistivity. You can see more information about these projects and others I am currently working on under the [Projects](https://glencstev.github.io/projects/) section of this site.
