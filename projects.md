# Undergraduate Projects
## Environmental Condition Sensor Array
This project was focused on detecting condition that would support mold growth. The end goal was to create a device that could be placed in a difficult to reach location, such as inside an air vent or behind machinery. It would then checked the humidity and temperature at regular intervals until it detected that they were both within range that would be conducive to mold growth. It would then close itself off to protect the internal circuity and send a signal over WiFi to a user's device, informing them that it had detected conditions that would support mold growth. The project focused on the workflow of PCB design from start to finish. The project included the implementation of analong and digital sensors, microcontroller programming and PCB design and population.

## Order Management System
This project was focused on the creation of a python-based GUI that would allow a user to add, append and view information stored in a .csv file. The program utilizes multiple python libraries, mainly: tkinter, pandas, reportlab and webbrowser. It was written with the intention of being able to edit the fields and easily add new ones to alter the system to match the needs of the user. The project focused on the use of common python libraries like Pandas and the use of libraries that may be more uncommon, such as tkinter and reportlab.
